%   The matlab subdirectory contains examples and help files.
    
%   To compile DSDP:

1.  Edit 'make.include' to define the DSDPROOT variable.  Set it
    equal to the location of the DSDP5.x directory (usually here).
    Additional variables, such as compiler flags and the location
    of a BLAS and LAPACK libraries, may also have to be modified.

2.  Compile the solver and examples.  Test them.
    > make all;

3.  (Optional) Test Matlab function if it compiled from within Matlab.
    Go the matlab directory and type:
    > check;
    Compare the output to the file check.out

Further HTML (Doxygen) documentation of the C language API for DSDP 
can be found by unzipping the file docs/DSDP5-api-html.zip.

Please notify the authors of DSDP of your experiences with it.  Your
